# cfg_flags

Go package to use an INI configuration file alongside the "flag" package.

Inspired by [iniflags](https://github.com/vharitonsky/iniflags), cfg_flags goal is to be simple, without any advanced features like configuration reloading.
It is only meant to integrate an INI file with golang's flag package, nothing more.
